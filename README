Blocked Traffic Flows Query will submit queries for blocked network flow connections from the last 24 hours. One may include filters such as an IP address, port number, port number exclusions, protocol number exclusions, and transmission type exclusions.

Repository contains a PHP web application.

## PHP Web Application
To install the PHP web application, clone repository and run the install.sh script on a minimal RHEL 9 based linux distribution. The install.sh script will:
1.  install nginx, php, policycoreutils, curl 8, and libcurl 8
2.  update the php.ini set timezone to match the local host timezone
3.  copy the web application php files to the default nginx web directory
4.  execute update-php-config.sh (this will prompt for the needed domain and authentication keys)
5.  generate and install SELinux policy to allow http connections

config.php example:
```
<?php
$fqdn='example.pce.local';
$port='8443';
$org='1';
$user='api_1b4a1234e4caa8667';
$key='97886resb17a11d1234f6be38fde6e991f759as1584759684520b26f6072aefe';
?>
```

API user only needs read permissions to query flows. Modify port_exclusions.csv and protocol_exclusions.csv as desired.
